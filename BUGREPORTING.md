# How to report bugs

When you report a bug, please always specify:

* which version of protobuf library do you use
* which of three ways to generate source code do you use
* which operating system you are on
* if you use some features, please specify these features
* if the generated code is incorrect, please provide both `.proto` input and generated output
  and codegen options if you have specified any.

Ideally, please create a small github project, which can be used to reproduce a problem with single command.

Thanks!
